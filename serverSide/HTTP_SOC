Here the abstraction for our P2P messaging application:
-  will be running over HTTP/1.1; conditional requests.
-  no data storage. Each communication session will record the key files in one random user.
  *  The keys will be created and deleted in every session. the prior keys' header will be stored in each prior host for later sessions
  *  The prior keys (first keys) will be created in manual
  *  For new participants, keys will be created manually.
  *  For key header encryption, SHA256 will be used.
